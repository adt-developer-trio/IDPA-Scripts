# Utilities

## Frequency Analyser

The Frequency Analyser takes a text file as input, counts the occurences of every alphanumeric character in it and generates the requested output.

## Heatmap Generator

Generates a heatmap image from a layout and the frequency of the keys.

# File Structures

## Frequency

This is the file format generated by the freq_analyse.py utility.

```js
{
  single: {
    'a': 123,
    'b': 12,
    ...
  },
  combinations: {
    'ab': 432,
    'bc': 42,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Layout

This is the data format used by the heatmap utility to represent the layout.

> This format was taken from [keyboard-layout-editor.com](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).

```js
[
  [
    "Esc",
    {
      "x": 1
    },
    "F1",
    "F2",
    ...,
    "Pause\nBreak"
  ],
  [
    {
      "y": 0.5
    },
    "~\n`",
    ...,
    {
      "w": 2
    },
    "Backspace",
    ...
  ]
]
```

It consists of a array of rows. Each row is in turn an array of keys. The key is simply the string representation of the glyph on the key.

Noteworthy are the special *keys* like `x`, `y` and `w` that you can see in the excerpt above. `x` and `y` signal that the is a gap in the layout in the respective direction. This is, for example, the case on most keyboard, after the number row or between the alphanumberic part of the keyboard and the numpad. The `w` object signals that the next key has a special size. By default every key is `1` unit in size. A `w` value of `2` means that the next key is `2` units large.
